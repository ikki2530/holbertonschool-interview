## File Description

[0-rain.py](0-rain.py) - Given a list of non-negative integers representing walls of width 1, calculate how much water will be retained after it rains.

- Prototype: def rain(walls)
- walls is a list of non-negative integers.
- Return: Integer indicating total amount of rainwater retained.
- Assume that the ends of the list (before index 0 and after index walls[-1]) are not walls, meaning they will not retain water.
- If the list is empty return 0.
